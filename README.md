# Cell_cycle-calculator
This code works like a calculator to analyze the results from cell cycle experiments. These experiments are done to determine at which phase the drug cause cell cycle arrest. 
Cells untreated or treated with drugs are ran on flow cytometer to count the cells and cells percentage at each phase is determined. This code works to analyze those information on percentages of cells in each phase. It can be used to analyze results from single or multiple experiments. An example of cell cycle analysis histogram generated by flow cytometry (created on biorender) and csv file format for the data analysis are shown in the figure. In the code, column names Treatment, G1%	, S% and G2% are used. Hence, user should have these column names. However, order of G1, S and G2 as columns doesn't matter.

Now as user run the code they will be asked to input file name, title and labels for the image.

Then a stacked barplot with all the cell cycle phases in one bar is generated.

Then user will be asked if they want to generate bar graph with or without statistical analysis. If typed 'yes', bar graphs with statistical analysis for all three cell cycle phases will be generated. It typed any other key then bar graphs without statistical analysis will be generated. I typed 'yes' here to get bar graph with statistical analysis.
